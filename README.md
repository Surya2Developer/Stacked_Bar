# Stacked_Bar
A stacked bar graph (or stacked bar chart) is a chart that uses bars to show comparisons between categories of data, but with ability to break down and compare parts of a whole. In this code, we can see data visualization of  four teams in four rounds of game by using Stacked Bar graph


In this graph, the four rounds are represented in four different colors with relation to scores of each team.
